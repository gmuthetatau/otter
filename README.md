Otter is an open source CMS for your chapter's website

The name Otter comes from the text abbreviation of our fraternity, Theta Tau. When texting and messaging we commonly referred to it as OT, so we've named our CMS OTter after this common abbreviation.

Otter is written in JavaScript, and is designed to make your chapter website simple to manage.

Otter is liscensed with the MIT liscense and is provided AS IS.
